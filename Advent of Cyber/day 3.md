# Log Analysis with Splunk

learned how to investigate an attack in Splunk by searching through the web and firewall logs and identifying suspicious activity using fields like user_agent, client_ip, and path.  spotted a major traffic spike and filtered out normal browser traffic to isolate the attacker’s IP and traced the full attack chain through a webshell. I then used the firewall logs to confirm C2 communication and measured how much data was exfiltrated
