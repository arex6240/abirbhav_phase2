# 1. Web Gauntlet

> Can you beat the filters?
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.


## Solution:

The challenge provides two website links: a login page and a filter page. The main objective is to bypass the login using SQL injection.

To log in as admin user, 'admin' is used as the username. Since the password is unknown, I can bypass the password check by using SQL comment sequences such as -- or /*.

i) In the first round, I enter admin'-- as the username works as it includes 'admin' and comments out the rest, skipping the password check  
ii) In the next round, the -- sequence is blocked, so admin'/* is used instead to bypass the filter.  
iii) For the following rounds, admin'/* continues to work as the filters remain similar  
iv) Later, bcz it is mentioned we can't used the admin string directly, the username is split and concatenated as ad'||'min'/* to avoid detection and still pass as admin  
v) Even when additional keywords like 'union' are filtered, the same concatenation trick (ad'||'min'/*) is effective since 'union' is not needed for the bypass  

After successfully logging in with these payloads, the challenge is completed

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_79a0ddc6}
```

## Concepts learnt:

learnt about few ways of SQL injection

## Notes:

goal was clear of doing sql injection, but made few errors here and there to figure out the correct combination

# 2. SSTI1

> I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out!
I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website here!


## Solution:

After launching the instance, I was greeted with a webpage which announced everything which I typed into the field there. Now since the name and hint of the challenge talk about Server Side Template Injection (SSTI), I researched on what this thing was exactly about. Then I learnt that its a issue that happens with some template engines like Jinja2 (Python), where the input fields values are gone and excuted as codes in the actual server which can lead to data leaks, and stuff. So I have to exploit this feature. 

I run : `{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls').read()}}`
which will list the files in the server

I find theres a objected named 'flag' which should be what im looking for.

Then I run: `{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('cat flag').read()}}`

I get the flag

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_bcf73b04}
```

## Concepts learnt:

learnt about Server side template injections and its vulnerabilities. It can be used to run and execute codes on web servers. Also learnt that template engines like Jinja2 are more vulnerable to such attacks if not careful

## Notes:

tried to input random values in the field like flag, answer, etc hoping to get the flag but nah didnt work.

# 3. Cookies

> Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:27177/


## Solution:

Since the name of the challenge is Cookies, I was sure that I had to manipulate the cookies in the refered webpage. I explore the website and notice that for the Home page the cookie value was `-1`. 
Then next when I enter the word `snickerdoodle`, cookie value became 0 and it printed a sentence.  

<img width="1869" height="908" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-26 023320" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74310e22-523b-4fa5-9d3c-bf7793055d98" />

I next put cookie value something random like 7 and notice that it printed something else. Then I put another random value and noticed that something else got printed again. So then I started testing every combination from 0 serially until when I received the flag at value 18.

0 ---> I love snickerdoodle cookies!  
1 --->I love chocolate chip cookies!  
2 --->I love oatmeal raisin cookies!  
3 --->I love gingersnap cookies!  
4 --->I love shortbread cookies!  
5 --->I love peanut butter cookies!  
6 --->I love whoopie pie cookies!  
7 --->I love sugar cookies!  
8 --->I love molasses cookies!  
9 --->I love kiss cookies!  
10 --->I love biscotti cookies!  
11 --->I love butter cookies!  
12 --->I love spritz cookies!  
13 --->I love snowball cookies!  
14 --->I love drop cookies!  
15 --->I love thumbprint cookies!  
16 --->I love pinwheel cookies!  
17 --->I love wafer cookies!  
18 --->`Flag: picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_064663be}`

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_064663be}
```

## Concepts learnt:

learnt how cookies and it's values are can be manipulated to trick websites

## Notes:

tried entering random values like 'flag' inside the field in hopes of getting something (tbh didnt have hopes but just tried). 

## Resources:

none
